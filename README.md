alljs
=====

The system is designed to facilitate prototyping Javascript functionality to your project. 
The advantages are that the system is actually the only one dependency: jQuery, 
which is used for easier DOM manipulation. In addition, the benefits of the system are:

    - Ability to wrap any other system or framework functionality and provide very 
    easy layer between DOM and JavaScript functionality. 
    No matter what you use: Backbone.js or jQuery with it's plugins or any other framework or library
    
    - Ability to exclude all JavaScript code from html
    
    - Ability to pass any number of arguments to a function in data-tags without necessity 
    to write id of element and play with it
    
    - Ability to include alljs file and modules in any order and don't worry about that
    
    - Ability to to write your functionality (that can use any frameworks and libraries) 
    using strong modular OOP structure
    
    - Functionality that helps you to develop and debug
    
    - Number of useful modules to solve certain problems

Do not forget that AllJS not a panacea, and is intended only to serve as a very thin layer between the actual JavaScript systems and html-document
